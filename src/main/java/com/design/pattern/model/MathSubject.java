/**
 * The {@code MathSubject} class is a concrete implementation of {@link Subject} that represents a

 * earned by a student are multiplied by {@code 0.7}, and the result is used as the final evaluation
 * score.
 *
 * <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Final grade = earnedPoints Ã— 0.7
 *   <li>Result is cast to an integer

 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Subject math = new MathSubject("Mathematics", 100);
 *
 * int rawPoints = 80;
 * int grade = math.getAutomaticEvaluation(rawPoints);
 *
 * System.out.println("Final grade: " + grade); // Final grade: 56
